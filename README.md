# BadApple-On-Github-Contribution-Calendar
Playing Badapple on github contribution Calendar || Code || Can be also used for other videos (like rickroll : ])


- You need to have a video named 'bad_apple.mp4' , which will be played
- **Note :  You will have to sign in with any github account on the browser window which opens up, because the github got different attributes and stuff ... when you are signed in and not...**
- You will only get 30 secs to sign in ... tho.. You can increase the sleep in the code... 
- The demo video was about 4.5 times faster than the OG rendering.. The OG rendering speed aint bad and also totally depends on systemload as you know...
